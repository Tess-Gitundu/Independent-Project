        <h2>Job Experience</h2>
        <p>After graduating from high school, I worked for BlueSky Laundry and Drycleaning as a Customer Care Executive Agent for two years. I then joined the freelancers force and became a transcriptionist for about three years. In mid 2020, I decided to start a mandazi business to help me work on my confidence. I sold mandazis for a couple of months then decided to shift gears a little bit. I later started an onion-selling business which lasted a couple of  months. I then started a small business, Undies By Tess which I was slowly building until I joined Moringa School.</p>

        <h1> Why Moringa School</h1>
        <p>Since I was young, I would appreciate how technology has changed lives in various ways. I loved how different fields of the economy had been affected by technology. I also appreciate the fact that it was technology that brought food to the table when I was young since my dad used to write articles for websites back in the day. Let's just say, technology has changed my life as well. I would always think of ways to make lives better through apps. I never really knew what to do with this passion, so I never really explored it until I learnt about Moringa's <strong><em>Women in Tech Scholarship Program</em></strong>. To say that was exactly what I needed at that particular point in time is an injustice. So I decided to apply and try my luck. I honestly didn't expect to get the scholarship. I mean, imagine competing with all these beautiful women out here! I couldn't believe it when I got the congratulatory email. It was a miracle! I decided to pursue Software Development to make sure I achieve this dream I'd been having for years. I'll make sure I become the best Software Engineer there is. I look forward to changing the world with technology as my weapon of change. So, look out!</p>

        <h1>My Hobbies and Interests</h1>
        <p>I have a couple of hobbies I enjoy. But the one that tops the list is reading. I love myself a good book. Not only does reading improve my grammar and speech, it also improves my thinking. I love the adventures, excitement, and the thrill, books give. It's always a mind-blowing experience to see how author's can take you to all these different places in our minds. I also enjoy cooking. Cooking was my firs love and still is. It is a beautiful work of art. Something I also enjoy is swimming. I have to confess though, I'm not a good swimmer, but that won't be for long. At least I wouldn't drown. I have a interests in biking, agriculture and travel.</p>
